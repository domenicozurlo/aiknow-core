# Irrifarm application hand-off

This integration lets an authenticated Irrifarm user open nao without seeing nao's login page. It does not change or replace Irrifarm's existing username/password login.

## Browser hand-off

The Irrifarm backend obtains an Irrifarm app JWT and returns an auto-submitting form to the browser. Passwords must never be sent to nao.

```html
<form method="post" action="https://nao.example.com/api/auth/sign-in/irrifarm">
	<input type="hidden" name="token" value="IRRIFARM_JWT" />
	<input type="hidden" name="username" value="IRRIFARM_USERNAME" />
	<!-- Required once IRRIFARM_AUTH_MODE=check-user -->
	<input type="hidden" name="regId" value="DEVICE_UUID" />
</form>
<script>
	document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

The endpoint validates the Irrifarm identity, fetches its authorized motherboards, creates or finds the linked nao user, sets the normal Better Auth session cookie, and redirects to `/`.

Open `/api/auth/irrifarm/test` to use the test hand-off form instead of creating the form manually. Paste the JWT, confirm the username, and submit it. It is available by default outside production.

To expose it temporarily in a test deployment running with `MODE=prod`, configure:

```env
MODE=prod
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://nao.example.com
IRRIFARM_TEST_PAGE_ENABLED=true
```

The page will be available at `https://nao.example.com/api/auth/irrifarm/test`. Set `IRRIFARM_TEST_PAGE_ENABLED=false` after testing. The page does not bypass authentication: a valid Irrifarm JWT is still required.

The JWT, username, or IDs must not be placed in the URL. Configure the Irrifarm application origin in `IRRIFARM_APP_ORIGINS` so Better Auth can enforce its origin check.

## Validation modes

`IRRIFARM_AUTH_MODE=fixture` is the temporary test path. It only accepts the configured fixture username. The JWT is still validated remotely by calling `GetMotherBoardsByClient`; only `CheckUser` is skipped.

```env
IRRIFARM_BASE_URL=https://app-irrifarm-service.example
IRRIFARM_AUTH_MODE=fixture
IRRIFARM_FIXTURE_USERNAME=domenico
IRRIFARM_FIXTURE_USER_ID=470
IRRIFARM_FIXTURE_CLIENT_ID=204
IRRIFARM_FIXTURE_CLIENT_LEVEL=20
```

`IRRIFARM_AUTH_MODE=check-user` is the final path. `regId` is mandatory and nao requires `CheckUser.active=true`. The returned values are mapped as follows:

| CheckUser         | GetMotherBoardsByClient |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `userClientId`    | `Client_Id`             |
| `userId`          | `USR_Id`                |
| `userClientLevel` | `IdClientLevel`         |

## nao user identity

The first successful hand-off creates a local Better Auth user and links it to `providerId=irrifarm` using the Irrifarm `userId` as the stable account identifier. Later hand-offs reuse the same user, refresh its Irrifarm attributes and authorized MBO list, and create a new session.

Better Auth requires an email value even when Irrifarm does not provide one. nao therefore stores a non-deliverable technical address internally. The frontend displays `Irrifarm account · ID <userId>` instead and must not use the technical address for newsletters, automations, or analytics.

Do not accept an email from an unsigned browser form as a verified identity attribute. A real email may replace the technical value only when it comes from a signed Irrifarm JWT claim or from the authenticated `CheckUser` response.

## Multiple motherboards

The authorized MBO list is refreshed at each successful Irrifarm sign-in:

- with exactly one MBO, phrases such as “my control unit” resolve automatically to that serial;
- with multiple MBOs, “my control units” and “of my competence” refer to the complete authorized set;
- when a request genuinely requires exactly one MBO but the user uses a singular ambiguous expression, the agent first retrieves the scoped motherboard aliases and serials and asks the user to choose;
- the user is never asked to provide an opaque serial without being shown the authorized choices.

These conversational rules improve usability only. Authorization is always enforced independently by the server-side SQL scope.

## SQL scope policy

Authorized MBO serials are stored server-side and sent to the Python query sidecar. The sidecar rewrites every configured physical table into an MBO-scoped subquery. It rejects unclassified tables for Irrifarm users.

The FastAPI sidecar must remain reachable only by the trusted nao backend: external callers must not be able to omit or replace `allowed_mbo_sns`.

```env
IRRIFARM_MBO_SCOPE_COLUMNS={"motherboards":"MBO_SN","senshistory":"MBO_SN","proghistory":"MboSn"}
IRRIFARM_MBO_UNSCOPED_TABLES=products
```

The mapping must include every queryable Irrifarm data table. Add only genuinely global, non-customer-specific tables to the unscoped allowlist.

## Large-scope query guardrails

Guardrails constrain query cost and response size without removing any authorized MBO from the user scope:

```env
IRRIFARM_LARGE_SCOPE_THRESHOLD=50
IRRIFARM_MAX_QUERY_ROWS=500
IRRIFARM_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
```

When the user has more MBOs than `IRRIFARM_LARGE_SCOPE_THRESHOLD`, the agent must start inventory requests with `COUNT(*)` or grouped summaries instead of loading the complete motherboard list. Discovery queries show at most 50 aliases/serials at a time. Telemetry and history queries must use a bounded time interval and aggregate in SQL; if the interval is missing, the agent asks for it before querying.

For every Irrifarm SQL request, the sidecar adds or clamps the outer query limit to `IRRIFARM_MAX_QUERY_ROWS`. The response reports the applied limit so the agent cannot mistake a truncated result for an exact total. On MySQL, the sidecar also injects the server-side `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` optimizer hint; the backend independently aborts its HTTP wait after `IRRIFARM_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` and asks the agent to narrow the MBO or time selection.

These controls are independent from database indexes. For large telemetry tables, verify that an appropriate index such as `(MBO_SN, SNS_SysDateIns)` already exists before considering a new one.

## API smoke test

The smoke command generates a JWT, optionally runs `CheckUser`, and calls `GetMotherBoardsByClient`. It never prints the JWT or password.

```powershell
$env:IRRIFARM_TEST_USERNAME='domenico'
$env:IRRIFARM_TEST_PASSWORD='...'
$env:IRRIFARM_TEST_USER_ID='470'
$env:IRRIFARM_TEST_CLIENT_ID='204'
$env:IRRIFARM_TEST_CLIENT_LEVEL='20'
npm.cmd run -w @nao/backend irrifarm:smoke
```

Set `IRRIFARM_TEST_REG_ID` to include `CheckUser` in the smoke test. Test credentials must stay outside committed files.
